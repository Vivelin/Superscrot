Superscrot is a program I started working on as an alternative to screenshot uploaders like ZScreen.
ZScreen, in my opinion, contains too much bullshit I'll never use. Others, like puush, require you
to use their hosting, which I don't want. Superscrot supports FTP and SFTP.

# Usage
Superscrot sits in the system tray and does its work when you press PrintScreen. The system tray icon
also offers a configuration editor and an option to toggle the developer console.

## Key bindings
- <kbd>PrintScr</kbd> takes a single screenshot that spans all monitors
- <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>PrintScr</kbd> takes a screenshot of the active window
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>PrintScr</kbd> allows you to select a region to take a screenshot of
- <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>PageUp</kbd> uploads copied images and image files
